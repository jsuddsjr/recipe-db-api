I baked the pie at 400F for 25 Minutes and 425 for 25 Minutes or so. I basted the top crust lightly with Melted Butter. Other than that I followed the recipe. It turned out awesome We polished off 1 pie just my wife and I We have the other pie left for Wednesday night!"

My husband was dismayed by the scant portion of chicken in the pie. I loved the pie. But instead of the 5 oz of chicken in the pie, next time I will make certain to have 20 oz or so of chicken. I used chicken thigh &amp; leg meat since I always use chicken thighs &amp; leg meat in any chicken dish because of the increased moisture and richer taste. I have the time to stew the chicken leg quarters with vegetables which yields delicious meat and broth since I am retired."

When we go out to dinner at the area sportsman club my wife always orders the chicken pot pie soup. This recipe is very very similar to the chicken pot pie soup my wife loves. I don’t understand it, but I made this recipe, deleted the carrots as I ran out and substituted fresh mushrooms. I made 2 small pies and the leftover I diluted it with a little bit of 1/2 and 1/2 cream and gave it to my wife in the soup form. She loved it. She said it was a lot better than she normally get as the sportsman club. Im guessing, she just does not like the pastry and the thickness of this pie filling. So when I make it, i also turn it into soup accompanied by garlic bread for my wife! Thank you! It’s the best!"

I like to increase the gravy, but I don't double it, more like I increase it a half of the original quantity. My husband doesn't like onions in his food, but I love the flavor, so I puree it in this dish, as sort of suggested by a user here. \n\nTry this, it's wonderful!"

I know some people don’t like to hear how the recipe was changed, but I find it helpful to know what works and how I can make it work even if I don’t have all the ingredients. I tossed in some slices of fresh mushrooms just before baking. That worked well too. (And had a bit of the mixture that wouldn’t fit in the pie so I put it in another dish using bread as my crust. We’ll see how that turns out.)"
