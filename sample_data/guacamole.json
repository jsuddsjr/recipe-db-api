Serving it with turkey tacos tonight and looking forward to spreading it on my morning toast in the morning! Edit: I took this to a Memorial Day barbecue a little over an hour away. Besides adding extra cilantro, garlic, and half of a large seeded and finely chopped jalapeño, I left the pits of avocados in the dip, plus squeezed a thin layer of lime juice over the top. Everyone said it was the best guac they ever had. When we got home, my husband said there was a bit left in the Tupperware and it was still green (no brown) so he put it in a small Tupperware with one pit and refrigerated it. I just checked it this morning - still green!"

However I made a rough version of this to see how it compares using just 1 Avocado and lime juice instead of fresh lime and I love it. I'll be making a large batch of this for parties and football games. Thanks!"
